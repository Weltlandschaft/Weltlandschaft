- 👋 Hi, I’m @Weltlandschaft
- 👀 I’m interested in modifications to modular/synthesizer systems and their firmware, as well as automation for Patreon and Wiki platforms.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 2x Noise Engineering machines that use Daisy, and 2x Ornament & Crime machines that use Teensy, among other assorted devices that allow alternative firmware flashing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on playtesting stuff that hopefully won't brick my machines.
